- How to add taint to a node ? 
    - kubectl taint    node node-name key=value:taint-effect 
- Taint effect: 
    - `taint-effect`  defines what happens to the PODs that DO NOT Tolerate the taint. Here are the types of taint-effect: 
        - NoSchedule - New Pods will not be scheduled in the node, existing pods remains untouched
        - PreferNoSchedule - Best effort
        - No execute - New pods will not be scheduled while existing pods will be evicted as well.
