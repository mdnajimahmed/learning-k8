- GOTTCA: create replicaset will take label into consideration, rs needs to create 3 pods with label app: nginx and there is already a pod running with label app: nginx replicaset will create 2 new PODs. And when we delete the replica set it will also delete by label, which means it will delete all 3 pods even though one pod with the same label was created before the repplicaset was deployed. 
- there is a relation between the selector labels and all the selector labels must be defined in the replicaset template labels , not replicaset meatadata labels. Replicaset metadata lables has nothing to do with the selector labels. 
- If replicaset asks to create 3 pods and selector labels are 1. app: nginx 2. type: front-end and there is already a pod runing with labe app:nginx, the replicaset will not take it into consideration because it expects two labels 1. app: nginx 2. type: front-end but it found only one 1. app: nginx  in the existing pod. Hence, it will create 3 new pod and delete will also delete 3 pods without touching the existing pod.
