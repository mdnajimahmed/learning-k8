# Pod lifecycle
## Pod phase
- `Pending`:	The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes cluster, but one or more of the containers has not been set up and made ready to run. This includes time a Pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as the time spent downloading container images over the network.
- `Running`:	The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
- `Succeeded`:	All containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
- `Failed`:	All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. That is, the container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
- `Unknown`	For some reason the state of the Pod could not be obtained. This phase typically occurs due to an error in communicating with the node where the Pod should be running.

# Pod conditions 

Condition complements pod status. Array of true/false falue. A Pod has a PodStatus, which has an array of PodConditions through which the Pod has or has not passed. Kubelet manages the following PodConditions:

- PodScheduled: the Pod has been scheduled to a node.
- PodHasNetwork: (alpha feature; must be enabled explicitly) the Pod sandbox has been successfully created and networking configured.
- ContainersReady: all containers in the Pod are ready.
- Initialized: all init containers have completed successfully.
- Ready: the Pod is able to serve requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching Services.
- * Ready is a pod condition not a pod status.

# Container States
While looking into Kubernetes Pod States, we also need to know about Container States. Once a Node assigns a Pod by the scheduler, the kubelet begins creating containers for that Pod using a container runtime. Waiting, Running, and Terminated are the three possible container states.

- Waiting: A container is Waiting if it is not in the Running or Terminated states. A container in the Waiting state is still performing the operations necessary for it to complete startup.
- Running: The Running status indicates that a container is running normally.
- Terminated: A container in the Terminated state started execution and then either finished or failed for some reason.

- [VVI] The restartPolicy applies to all containers in the Pod
