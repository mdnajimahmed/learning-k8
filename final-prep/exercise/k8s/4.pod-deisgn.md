- Create 3 pods with names nginx1,nginx2,nginx3. All of them should have the label app=v1
    - for i in `seq 1 3`;do kubectl run nginx$i --image=nginx -l app=v1; done;
    - for i in `seq 1 3`;do kubectl run nginx$i --image=nginx --labels=app=v1; done;
    - kubectl get pods --show-labels

- Show all labels of the pods
    - kubectl get pods --show-labels

- Change the labels of pod 'nginx2' to be app=v2
    - kubectl label pod nginx2 app=v2 --overwrite

- Get the label 'app' for the pods (show a column with APP labels)
    - [VVI] kubectl get po -L app
- Get only the 'app=v2' pods
    -  kubectl get pods -l app=v2 --show-labels
    -  kubectl get pods -l app=v2 -L app

- Add a new label tier=web to all pods having 'app=v2' or 'app=v1' labels
    - kubectl label pods -l='app in (v1,v2)' tier=web

- Add an annotation 'owner: marketing' to all pods having 'app=v2' label
    - kubectl label pod -l app=v2 owner=marketing
    - kubectl get pods -l app=v2 --show-labels
- Remove the 'app' label from the pods we created before
    - kubectl label pod -l app app-

- Create a pod that will be deployed to a Node that has the label 'accelerator=nvidia-tesla-p100'
    - kubectl label node minikube-m02 accelerator=nvidia-tesla-p100
    - kubectl get nodes -L accelerator
    - kubectl apply -f 022.yml 
    - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/ `This is a intutive straightforward solution (Assign Pods to Nodes)`
    - kubectl get pods -o wide

- Annotate pods nginx1, nginx2, nginx3 with "description='my description'" value `because of the space we need to put it inside double quote`
    - kubectl annotate pod nginx{1..3} description='my description'
- Check the annotations for pod nginx1
    - kubectl annotate pod nginx1 --list
- Remove the annotations for these three pods
    - kubectl annotate pod nginx{1..3} description-
    - kubectl annotate pod nginx{1..3} --list
- Remove these pods to have a clean state in your cluster
    - kubectl delete pod nginx{1..3}
- Create a deployment with image nginx:1.18.0, called nginx, having 2 replicas, defining port 80 as the port that this container exposes (don't create a service for this deployment)
    - 
View the YAML of this deployment

View the YAML of the replica set that was created by this deployment

Get the YAML for one of the pods

Check how the deployment rollout is going

Update the nginx image to nginx:1.19.8

Check the rollout history and confirm that the replicas are OK

Undo the latest rollout and verify that new pods have the old image (nginx:1.18.0)

Do an on purpose update of the deployment with a wrong image nginx:1.91

Verify that something's wrong with the rollout

Return the deployment to the second revision (number 2) and verify the image is nginx:1.19.8

Check the details of the fourth revision (number 4)

Scale the deployment to 5 replicas

Autoscale the deployment, pods between 5 and 10, targetting CPU utilization at 80%

Pause the rollout of the deployment

Update the image to nginx:1.19.9 and check that there's nothing going on, since we paused the rollout

Resume the rollout and check that the nginx:1.19.9 image has been applied

Delete the deployment and the horizontal pod autoscaler you created

Implement canary deployment by running two instances of nginx marked as version=v1 and version=v2 so that the load is balanced at 75%-25% ratio

Jobs
Create a job named pi with image perl:5.34 that runs the command with arguments "perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'"

Wait till it's done, get the output

Create a job with the image busybox that executes the command 'echo hello;sleep 30;echo world'

Follow the logs for the pod (you'll wait for 30 seconds)

See the status of the job, describe it and see the logs

Delete the job

Create a job but ensure that it will be automatically terminated by kubernetes if it takes more than 30 seconds to execute

Create the same job, make it run 5 times, one after the other. Verify its status and delete it

Create the same job, but make it run 5 parallel times

Cron jobs
kubernetes.io > Documentation > Tasks > Run Jobs > Running Automated Tasks with a CronJob

Create a cron job with image busybox that runs on a schedule of "*/1 * * * *" and writes 'date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster' to standard output

See its logs and delete it

Create the same cron job again, and watch the status. Once it ran, check which job ran by the created cron job. Check the log, and delete the cron job

Create a cron job with image busybox that runs every minute and writes 'date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster' to standard output. The cron job should be terminated if it takes more than 17 seconds to start execution after its scheduled time (i.e. the job missed its scheduled time).

Create a cron job with image busybox that runs every minute and writes 'date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster' to standard output. The cron job should be terminated if it successfully starts but takes more than 12 seconds to complete execution.
