        - create the pod using the above yaml.
        - kubectl exec -it bb3 -- ls /etc/config
        - kubectl exec -it bb3 -- cat /etc/config/key1
        - kubectl exec -it bb3 -- cat /etc/config/key2
- Same experiments can be repeated using ----from-env-file
    - kubectl create configMap CONFIG_MAP_NAME --from-env-file=app_config.txt (property-like keys)
- Conclusion on property-like keys
    - We can use --from-literal multiple times
    - We can use --from-env-file
    - We can mount as environment variable (even a subset or the full config map)
    - We can mount as file (even a subset using configmap->name->items->[ key,path ] or the full config map -- just ignore the items)
# Task 02: (#file-like keys)
- Note:
    - The idea is that you have a properties file and you want to have that `file` to be mounted inside your pod so that you can read the environment variables from that file during runtime. Hence, we can not use envFrom and choose key and volume mount is the only option.

    - Create the following pod
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: bb4
    spec:
    containers:
        - name: bb4
        image: busybox
        command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 300" ]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /etc/config
    volumes:
        - name: config-volume
        configMap:
            name: cmff
    restartPolicy: Never
    ```
    - kubectl exec -it bb4 -- ls /etc/config
    - kubectl exec -it bb4 -- cat /etc/config/data.properties
- [VVI] I still need to figure out if there is any way to mount a single key from the file-like keys and mount it as environment variable, I guess it's called file-like keys for a reason.
- You can combine property-like keys and file-like keys in the same ConfigManager.
- Volume mount comparison for property-like keys and file-like keys
```
- All the property-like keys are file
volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        name: cmfl
    ---
- Only the selected keys from the property-like keys are file
volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        name: cmfl
        items:
        - key: "key1"
          path: key1
    ---
    volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        name: cmff
- The properties file itself is mounted (As there is no property like keys and only one file line keys)
```
- Summary for volume mount : Each key is a file in the pod, filename is the name of the key.
- Updating configmap updates the view inside the pod `eventually not in real time`, a control loop periodically syncs config map and pods view, to make it more efficient we can declare immutable config map `immutable: true`. Details in the documentation `Mounted ConfigMaps are updated automatically` and `Immutable ConfigMaps`.
- A common exam scenario is to change the value of an environment variable, the right strategy is to dump the yaml for the pod, delete the pod, make necessary changes and re-create the pod. Pretty much same for other k8s resources.

- Declarative approach 
```

*Watch carefully, in the declarative approach we use a k8s spec file which is a k8s object, hence the secret needs to be base64 encoded.*
- Conclusion:
    - The API is same as configmap except the data is base64 encrypted when it enters into k8s system.
    - On the file, it's not encoded, its encoded only in the k8s system.
    - When they are passed to pod (either as env or as file) they are decrypted back.

# Security Context:
- A bit advanced and more related to sys admin
- Be careful about where to declare the security context - at pod level or at container level 

# Service account:
- We can not edit the service account of a pod. We will have to delete the pod and recreate the pod.

# Pod to Node relationships:

- Assigning Pods to Nodes :
    You can use any of the following methods to choose where Kubernetes schedules specific Pods:
    - nodeSelector field matching against node labels (The recommended way), however we can not and/or/in/not type advanced selection.For that we need affinity.
        ```
        nodeSelector:
            accelerator: nvidia-tesla-p100
        ```
    - Affinity and anti-affinity (requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution,preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution)
        - Node affinity: Node affinity is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement).
        ```
        affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
            - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
                operator: In
                values:
                - antarctica-east1
                - antarctica-west1
        preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
            preference:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: another-node-label-key
                operator: In
                values:
                - another-node-label-value
        ```
        - Node anti-affinity: Node anti-affinity aka Taints allow a node to repel a set of pods.
        - nodeName : Hardcoded binding
    ```
    - nodeName: kube-01
   
   ```
    - Pod topology spread constraints

# Taints and Tolerations
- kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule - `The taint has key key1, value value1, and taint effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.`
- kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:PreferNoSchedule - `This is a "preference" or "soft" version of NoSchedule -- the system will try to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not required`
- kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute - `The pod will be evicted from the node (if it is already running on the node), and will not be scheduled onto the node (if it is not yet running on the node).`
- kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-
- Operators: Exists,Equal
- Taints by default repeals unless there is a toleration.
- Example:
    - kubectl get pods
    - kubectl run ng --image=nginx
    - kubectl get nodes
    - kubectl taint nodes minikube key=m4large:NoExecute
    - kubectl taint nodes minikube key=m4large:NoExecute-
    - kubectl taint nodes minikube ec2=m4large:NoExecute hdd=gen1:NoExecute
    - kubectl describe node minikube | grep -i 'taint' -A2
    - kubectl run ng --image=nginx -o yaml --dry-run=client
    - kubectl apply -f taint.yml
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    labels:
        run: ng1
    name: ng1
    spec:
    containers:
    - image: nginx
        name: ng1
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    restartPolicy: Always
    tolerations:
    - key: "ec2"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "m4large"  # Allow this pod to go to ec2=m4large, however it's not gurranted , effectively what I am telling here is `I don't mind if the pod goes to ec2=m4large`
        effect: "NoExecute"
    - key: "hdd" # Effectively what I am telling here is `I don't mind if the pod goes to an instance that is running on hdd`
        operator: "Exists" 
        effect: "NoExecute"
    ```
    - kubectl get pods - working fine
    - kubectl taint nodes minikube ec2=m4large:NoExecute- hdd=gen1:NoExecute-
    - kubectl describe node minikube | grep -i 'taint' -A2

# Always
- Delete the k8s object and create a new one especially for pods.
```
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
